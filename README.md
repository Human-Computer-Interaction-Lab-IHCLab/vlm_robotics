This repository provides a **reproducible hybrid framework** that integrates a **multimodal Large Language Model (LLM/VLM)** as a semantic reasoning module with **deterministic inverse kinematics** for robotic object manipulation.  
The system is implemented on the **Yahboom DOFBOT** educational arm and demonstrates how symmetry can be applied **as a design principle** rather than a learned feature.

> Designed for **educational and research purposes**, this project aims to lower entry barriers in mechatronics education by showing how generative AI can interact with deterministic robotic control.

## üß© Overview

### Robot Side (`MainRobot.py`)
- Initializes and homes the robotic arm.  
- Captures a camera image and exposes it through two TCP servers:  
  - **Image Server** on port `6103`.  
  - **Command Server** on port `6104`.

### Client Side (`RuedaColorEs.py`)
- Connects to the robot‚Äôs image server to retrieve the latest frame.  
- Sends both **text and image** to an OpenAI multimodal model (`gpt-4o`).  
- Interprets the model‚Äôs reply (e.g., ‚Äúlower right‚Äù) and sends the corresponding motion commands to the robot via TCP.
