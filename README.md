This repository provides a **reproducible hybrid framework** that integrates a **multimodal Large Language Model (LLM/VLM)** as a semantic reasoning module with **deterministic inverse kinematics** for robotic object manipulation.  
The system is implemented on the **Yahboom DOFBOT** educational arm and demonstrates how symmetry can be applied **as a design principle** rather than a learned feature.

> Designed for **educational and research purposes**, this project aims to lower entry barriers in mechatronics education by showing how generative AI can interact with deterministic robotic control.

## 🧩 Overview

### Robot Side (`MainRobot.py`)
- Initializes and homes the robotic arm.
- Captures a camera image and exposes it through two TCP servers:
  - **Image Server** on port `6103`.
  - **Command Server** on port `6104`.

### Client Side (`RuedaColorEs.py`)
- Connects to the robot’s image server to retrieve the latest frame.
- Sends both **text and image** to an OpenAI multimodal model (`gpt-4o`).
- Interprets the model’s reply (e.g., “lower right”) and sends the corresponding motion commands to the robot via TCP.
